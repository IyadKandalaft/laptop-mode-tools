.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
This manual page documents briefly the 
.B /usr/sbin/laptop_mode
command. 
.B /usr/sbin/laptop_mode
is a program that enables and 
disables laptop mode. Laptop mode is a feature included in Linux 
kernels with versions 2.6.6 and higher, and 2.4.23 and higher. The 
intent of laptop mode is to increase battery life by letting your 
hard drive spin down. This is achieved by grouping disk write 
activity into "chunks" that are spaced at larger intervals than 
they normally would be.
