# Ethernet power saving settings
# ------------------------------
#
# There are various ways to save power with ethernet. This section allows you
# to control the speed of your ethernet connection, and your wakeup-on-LAN
# settings. Both these things can have quite a power impact if you use Ethernet.
#

# Control Ethernet settings?
CONTROL_ETHERNET=0

# Speed to throttle to when ON_BATTERY and ON_AC
# Please use the MIN and MAX values as reported by ethtool and set it accordingly
# To get the speed capacity supported by your ethernet card, as user "root" run
# "ethtool eth0", where eth0 is your physical ethernet device.
# Example:
# MIN_SPEED=10
# MAX_SPEED=1000
#
# Note: If you don't know how to find the speed of your ethernet card, leave the
# following values as it is.
MIN_SPEED="slowest"
MAX_SPEED="fastest"

# Disable wakeup-on-LAN? This will disable wakeup-on-LAN unconditionally,
# independent of battery power. It will save power while your laptop is turned
# off or in standby mode.
DISABLE_WAKEUP_ON_LAN=1

# Handle throttling of the ethernet deivce under specific circumstances
BATT_THROTTLE_ETHERNET=1

# A list of the ethernet devices that should be controlled.
